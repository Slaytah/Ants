# Ants
Implementations of Breadth first, Dijkstar and AStar algorithms, applied to a grid of hexagons.

Why Ants? This was a programming test where the scenario given was a honeycomb where one cell was filled with honey, 
several cells were filled with wax (which could not be eaten through) and the ant had a fixed number of cells that could
be eaten through. Task was to find the shortest path from the start position (given by the id of the cell) and the end
position (id), avoiding the wax cells.
